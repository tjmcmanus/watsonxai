This code sample shows how to invoke watsonx.ai Generative AI API that's hosted in IBM Cloud.
At this time the API endpoint is hardcoded in the API itself (can't be edited).
You will need to provide your own API key for accessing watsonx.ai
This example shows a simple GENERATE/TRANSFORM use case without comprehensive prompt tuning.

    So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal sale for around $49 in the month of
    November, about  half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) 
    around the second week of December the prices all went up to about anywhere from 
    between $70-$89 for the same system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or 
    so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part 
    where the blade locks into place doesnâ€™t look as good as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I 
    plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the 
    blender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping 
    blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade 
    if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and 
    vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making 
    sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so 
    much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. 
    I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall 
    quality has gone done in these types of products, so they are kind of counting on brand recognition and 
    consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days.
